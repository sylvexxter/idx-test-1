    "Training and awareness": [
        "Security Awareness Training: The organisation has put in place cybersecurity awareness training for all employees to ensure that employees are aware of the security practices and behaviour expected of them. Organisations may meet this requirement in different ways, e.g., provide self-learning materials for employees or engaging external training providers. Employees are equipped with the security knowledge and awareness to identify and mitigate against cyber threats?"
    ],
    "Asset management": [
        "An up-to-date asset inventory: Is there an up-to-date inventory of all the hardware and software assets in the organisation.",
        "Cloud Usage: Does the organization use certified cloud applications and cloud instances?",
        "Usage of unauthorized or End of Life assets: Does the organization replace hardware and software assets that are unauthorised or have reached their respective End of Life Support?",
        "Approval to use end of life software: In the event of any continued use of End of Life Support assets, has the organisation assessed and understood the risk, obtains approval from senior management, and monitor it until the asset is replaced.",
        "Process to onboard new hardware and software: Is there an authorisation process developed to onboard new hardware and software into the organization. Organisations may meet this requirement in different ways, e.g., email approval from senior management, ensuring that new hardware and software come from official or trusted sources, performing malware scans to verify that the asset is clean and maintaining asset whitelisting/blacklisting",
        "Process to onboard new hardware and software: The date of authorisation of software and hardware is recorded into the asset inventory list after obtaining the relevant dispensation, e.g., obtaining email approval or through the use of an approval form.",
        "Disposing of assets: Before disposing of any hardware asset, the organisation ensures that all confidential information have been deleted, e.g., encrypting hard disk before reformatting and overwriting it."
    ],
    "Data protection and privacy": [
        "Inventory of Data: Does the organisation identifies and maintains an inventory of business-critical data in the organisation. Organisations may meet this requirement in different ways, e.g., using spreadsheet or asset inventory software. The inventory list shall contain details of the data as follows:\n– Description;\n– Data classification and/or sensitivity;\n– Location; and\n– Retention period.",
        "Data Protection: The organisation establishes a process to protect its business-critical data, e.g., password protected documents, encryption of personal data (at rest) and/or emails.",

    ],
    "Backups": [
        "Identify business critical systems: Has the organisation identified business-critical systems and those containing essential business information and performed backup? What needs to be backed up is guided by identifying what is needed for business recovery in the event of a cybersecurity incident. Examples of business-critical systems include stock-trading system, railway operating and control system. Examples of essential business information include financial data and business transactions.",
        "Backup Cadence: Are backups performed on a regular basis, with the backup frequency aligned to the business requirements and how many days’ worth of data the organisation can afford to lose."
    ],
    "System security": [
        "Security configurations: Does the organization enforce security configuration on assets including desktop computers, servers and routers. Organisations may meet this requirement in different ways, e.g., adopting industry recommendations and standards such as Center for Internet Security (CIS) benchmarks on configuration guidelines across multiple vendor products, running baseline security analyser and/or using system configuration scripts.",
        "Security configurations: Weak or default configurations are avoided or updated before using them, e.g., changing default password and performing deep scanning with anti-malware solution instead of standard scan.",
        "Security configurations: Insecure configurations and weak protocols are replaced or upgraded to address the associated vulnerabilities, e.g., using Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) over normal Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to encrypt data communication and upgrading Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) to Wi-Fi Protected Access 2/3 (WPA2/WPA3) to enhance the Wi-Fi security standards.",
        "Security configurations: Features, services, or applications that are not in use are disabled or removed, e.g., disabling file sharing services, software macros and File Transfer Protocol (FTP) ports.",
        "Security Configuration: Automatic connection to open networks and auto-run feature of non-essential programs (other than backup or anti-malware solution, etc.) is disabled.",
        "Updates: The organisation prioritises the implementation of critical or important updates for operating systems and applications (e.g., security patches) to be applied as soon as possible."
